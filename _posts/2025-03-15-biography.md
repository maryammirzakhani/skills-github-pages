# Maryam Mirzakhani: A Trailblazing Mathematician

**Maryam Mirzakhani** (1977â€“2017) was an Iranian mathematician renowned for her groundbreaking work in geometry and dynamical systems. In 2014, she became the first woman and the first Iranian to win the **Fields Medal**, the highest honor in mathematics, for her contributions to the understanding of the geometry and dynamics of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces.

## Early Life and Education  
Born in **Tehran, Iran**, Mirzakhani displayed an early passion for mathematics, winning **gold medals** at the *International Mathematical Olympiad*. She earned her Ph.D. from **Harvard University** in 2004 under the mentorship of **Curtis McMullen**.

## Academic Contributions  
Her research focused on complex mathematical structures, including:
- **Hyperbolic surfaces**  
- **Moduli spaces**  
- **Ergodic theory**  

Her work had a profound impact on multiple fields of **mathematics and physics**.

## Career and Legacy  
Mirzakhani became a professor at **Stanford University**, where she continued to make significant discoveries. Known for her deep intuition and visual approach to problem-solving, she was admired not only for her intellect but also for her humility and creativity.

She tragically passed away from **breast cancer** in 2017 at the age of 40. Despite her short life, her legacy continues to inspire **women in STEM** and mathematicians worldwide.
